**ABOUT ME**

Iâ€™ve had a few vastly different jobs (videography, ESL teaching) and decided it is time for a change! **I thirst for knowledge and new challenges.** I needed a profession that allow me **constantly self-develop** and **use my talent to find errors.** And that's how I changed my life, choosing to be a **software tester.**

**Why do I love being a software tester?** I can be the **guardian of software quality.** Testing is an endless opportunity to find typos, logical errors or functionalities that can work better and easier. Another plus of being a tester is using my **creativity.** I always try to **find a new way to "break" something in the software or use it unusually.** As a tester, I can use my **empathy**. I always try to **put myself in someone else's shoes and look at software through their eyes.** I also care about other colleagues, so I try to write test cases so that the reproduction of the steps comes easily.

**What are my skills?** 
During my training process, I have learned **SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Confluence, Postman,** and **HTML/CSS and JavaScript** basics.

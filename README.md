**ABOUT ME**

I’ve had a few vastly different jobs (videography, ESL teaching) and decided it's time for a change! **I thirst for knowledge and new challenges.** I knew I needed a profession that lets me **constantly develop myself** and **use my talent to find errors.** And that's how I changed my life, choosing to be a **delve into the world of QA.**

**Why do I love being a software tester?** 
<br>I can be the **guardian of software quality.** Testing is an endless opportunity to find typos, logical errors, or functionalities that can work better. Another plus of being a tester is using my **creativity.** I always try to **find a new way to "break" something in the software or use it unusually.** As a tester, I can use my **empathy**. I always try to **put myself in someone else's shoes and look at software through their eyes.** I also care about other colleagues, so I try to write test cases so that the reproduction of the steps comes easily.

The skills I've developed as an ESL teacher and videographer, such as attention to detail, communication, and problem-solving, align perfectly with the requirements of a QA tester. I'm hoping this new career path will ... 

I'm **excited** to transition into **Quality Assurance** because it taps into my strengths in **attention to detail, problem-solving, and clear communication.** My background as an ESL teacher and videographer has given me the ability to **stay organized** and **provide constructive feedback** – skills that I believe are essential for QA testing.

**What really draws me to this field** is the challenge and satisfaction of ensuring high-quality software. I’m also looking for a role that offers flexibility and stability, allowing me to maintain a healthy work-life balance while continuing to grow in my career. I’m **eager to bring my curiosity and commitment** to quality to a QA team. 

**What are my skills?** 
During my training process, I have learned **SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Confluence, Postman,** and **HTML/CSS and JavaScript** basics.

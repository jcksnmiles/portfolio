**ABOUT ME**

Iâ€™ve had a few vastly different jobs (videography, ESL teaching) and decided it is time for a change! **I thirst for knowledge and new challenges.** I needed a profession that allow me **constantly self-develop** and **use my talent to find errors.** And that's how I changed my life, choosing to be a **software tester.**

**Why do I love being a software tester?** I can be the **guardian of software quality.** Testing is an endless opportunity to find typos, logical errors or functionalities that can work better and easier. Another plus of being a tester is using my **creativity.** I always try to **find a new way to "break" something in the software or use it unusually.** As a tester, I can use my **empathy**. I always try to **put myself in someone else's shoes and look at software through their eyes.** I also care about other colleagues, so I try to write test cases so that the reproduction of the steps comes easily.

**What are my skills?** 
During my training process, I have learned **SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Confluence, Postman,** and **HTML/CSS and JavaScript** basics.

This test scenario involves verifying that users can smoothly and accurately complete the booking process for events on The National Theatre's website. It ensures that the system correctly handles date selection, ticket quantity input, payment processing, email notifications, and cross-browser compatibility. Additionally, the scenario assesses the system's performance under load, the end-to-end user experience, and usability on mobile devices.

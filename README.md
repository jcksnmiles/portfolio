# PORTFOLIO

**About Me**
<br>Iâ€™m a QA Analyst with 2+ years of experience ensuring the quality and stability of 20+ applications across industries like FinTech, e-commerce, and MedTech. My approach blends meticulous testing with clear, detailed documentation; from test cases and bug reports to reproducible steps and process notes, all aimed at improving product reliability and team efficiency.

Iâ€™ve worked across globally distributed teams, collaborated with developers and PMs, and contributed to multiple full test cycles, including exploratory, functional, regression, and API testing. Iâ€™m comfortable in both manual and automated testing environments, with growing fluency in Playwright, Selenium, and Postman.

With a background in education and strong communication skills in both English and Spanish, Iâ€™m always focused on clarity, precision, and improving user experience, whether through finding a critical bug or refining a test flow.

## PROJECTS
**1. Muso-Method Web App**
<br><img width="540" height="304" alt="Screenshot 2025-04-15 at 9 12 48â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/687ba096-0284-4f2e-aa26-d86a4758b602" />
<br>**Description**: This project simulates end-to-end Quality Assurance testing for Muso-Method, a self-guided web platform designed to teach classical music through interactive lessons. As part of my QA Analyst/Engineer portfolio, I designed and executed test strategies across core user flowsâ€”sign-up, navigation, lesson playback, and account managementâ€”focusing on usability, functionality, and edge-case handling.

Test documentation includes structured user stories, tasks, test cases, and detailed bug reports modeled after real-world team workflows in Jira. Testing is ongoing and based on black-box exploratory techniques with a strong emphasis on UX clarity, validation, and functional integrity.

<br>**Impact:**
* Developed and executed 10 test cases across 4 major user flows.
* Identified 8 edge cases to uncover hidden usability or logic issues.
* Designed for team-ready integration with Jira, making this a realistic, production-style QA sample.
* Logged real bugs found during testing, including validation failures and UI behavior inconsistencies.

**2. Personal QA Learning Roadmap** (Trello)

**Test Plans**
1. [American School e-Learning Platform](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17018988/Test.Plan_.American.School.1.pdf)
<br> I developed a comprehensive test plan for an e-learning platform that offers exam preparation courses for non-native English speakers, including TOEFL iBT, TOEIC, SAT, GRE, GMAT, IELTS, and Duolingo. The test plan outlined the testing strategy, scope, objectives, and execution approach. It covered key functionalities such as content delivery (text, video, audio, quizzes), speaking and writing submission features, user role management, and performance testing. My plan also ensured cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness on mobile devices and provided a structured defect management process using Jira.

2. [CareConnect: Patient Portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17019010/Test.Plan_.CareConnect.Patient.Portal.1.pdf)
<br>I created a comprehensive, **hypothetical** test plan for the CareConnect Patient Portal, a web-based healthcare application. The plan outlined testing strategies for key functionalities, including appointment scheduling, secure messaging, medical record access, and telehealth consultations. I developed test cases for unit, integration, and system testing, ensuring HIPAA compliance and secure data handling. The plan also includes performance testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and regression testing. This would ensure a seamless, secure, and user-friendly experience for both patients and healthcare providers.

**Test Cases**
1. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKYxR1ICImuAcfk6Uwk42Ug9glBIyHWM23_Tl1jC8BI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> The National Theatre</a>
<br>TEST SCENARIO: Comprehensive Validation of the Online Booking System for The National Theatre Website.
   - This test scenario involves verifying that users can smoothly and accurately complete the booking process for events on The National Theatre's website. It ensures that the system correctly handles date selection, ticket quantity input, payment processing, email notifications, and cross-browser compatibility. Additionally, the scenario assesses the system's performance under load, the end-to-end user experience, and usability on mobile devices.

**ABOUT ME**
<br>Professionally, I’ve had the opportunity to explore different careers, from videography to ESL teaching, but now I’m ready for a new challenge. **Driven by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge,** I wanted a profession that would allow me to **constantly develop new skills** while leveraging my talent for spotting errors. That’s how I found my way into the world of **Quality Assurance.**

**Why do I love being a software tester?** 
<br>As a software tester, I get to be a **champion of excellence**. I love the endless opportunities to spot typos, logical errors, and areas where functionality can be improved. The role also allows me to tap into my **creativity**—I’m always on the lookout for new ways to "break" software or test it in unconventional ways. My **empathy** also plays a big part in my work; I strive to see the software through the eyes of the end-user and write test cases that are easy for my colleagues to follow.

I'm **excited** to transition into **Quality Assurance** because it taps into my strengths in **attention to detail, problem-solving, and clear communication.** My background as an ESL teacher and videographer has given me the ability to **stay organized** and **provide constructive feedback** – skills that I believe are essential for QA testing.

**What really draws me to this field** is the challenge and satisfaction of ensuring high-quality software. I’m also looking for a role that offers flexibility and stability, allowing me to maintain a healthy work-life balance while continuing to grow in my career. I’m **eager to bring my curiosity and commitment** to quality to a QA team. 

**What are my skills?** 
During my training, I’ve gained experience with tools like **SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Confluence, Postman,** and the basics of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.** I’m eager to bring my **curiosity and commitment to quality** to a QA team, where I can continue to learn and contribute meaningfully.

**Test Plans**
1. [American School e-Learning Platform](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17018988/Test.Plan_.American.School.1.pdf)
<br> I developed a comprehensive test plan for an e-learning platform that offers exam preparation courses for non-native English speakers, including TOEFL iBT, TOEIC, SAT, GRE, GMAT, IELTS, and Duolingo. The test plan outlined the testing strategy, scope, objectives, and execution approach. It covered key functionalities such as content delivery (text, video, audio, quizzes), speaking and writing submission features, user role management, and performance testing. My plan also ensured cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness on mobile devices and provided a structured defect management process using Jira.

2. [CareConnect: Patient Portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17019010/Test.Plan_.CareConnect.Patient.Portal.1.pdf)
<br>I created a comprehensive, **hypothetical** test plan for the CareConnect Patient Portal, a web-based healthcare application. The plan outlined testing strategies for key functionalities, including appointment scheduling, secure messaging, medical record access, and telehealth consultations. I developed test cases for unit, integration, and system testing, ensuring HIPAA compliance and secure data handling. The plan also includes performance testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and regression testing. This would ensure a seamless, secure, and user-friendly experience for both patients and healthcare providers.

**Test Cases**
1. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dKYxR1ICImuAcfk6Uwk42Ug9glBIyHWM23_Tl1jC8BI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> The National Theatre</a>
<br>TEST SCENARIO: Comprehensive Validation of the Online Booking System for The National Theatre Website.
   - This test scenario involves verifying that users can smoothly and accurately complete the booking process for events on The National Theatre's website. It ensures that the system correctly handles date selection, ticket quantity input, payment processing, email notifications, and cross-browser compatibility. Additionally, the scenario assesses the system's performance under load, the end-to-end user experience, and usability on mobile devices.

**ABOUT ME**
<br>Professionaly, I’ve had the opportunity to explore different careers, from videography to ESL teaching, but now I’m ready for a new challenge. **Driven by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge,** I wanted a profession that would allow me to **constantly develop new skills** while leveraging my talent for spotting errors. That’s how I found my way into the world of **Quality Assurance.**

**Why do I love being a software tester?** 
<br>As a software tester, I get to be a **champion of excellence**. I love the endless opportunities to spot typos, logical errors, and areas where functionality can be improved. The role also allows me to tap into my **creativity**—I’m always on the lookout for new ways to "break" software or test it in unconventional ways. My **empathy** also plays a big part in my work; I strive to see the software through the eyes of the end-user and write test cases that are easy for my colleagues to follow.

I'm **excited** to transition into **Quality Assurance** because it taps into my strengths in **attention to detail, problem-solving, and clear communication.** My background as an ESL teacher and videographer has given me the ability to **stay organized** and **provide constructive feedback** – skills that I believe are essential for QA testing.

**What really draws me to this field** is the challenge and satisfaction of ensuring high-quality software. I’m also looking for a role that offers flexibility and stability, allowing me to maintain a healthy work-life balance while continuing to grow in my career. I’m **eager to bring my curiosity and commitment** to quality to a QA team. 

**What are my skills?** 
During my training, I’ve gained experience with tools like **SQL, Chrome DevTools, Jira, Confluence, Postman,** and the basics of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.** I’m eager to bring my **curiosity and commitment to quality** to a QA team, where I can continue to learn and contribute meaningfully.
